A spooky syntax theme perfect for the Halloween season.

Ported from [dhh](https://github.com/dhh)'s [Sublime sytax theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/All_Hallows_Eve).

## Installation

Open a console and type:

`$ apm install all-hallows-eve-syntax`

Or, inside Atom's settings select Install and then search for this package.

## Screenshot

Looks great with [atom-material-ui](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui)!
